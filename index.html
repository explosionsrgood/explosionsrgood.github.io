  	Ah, what is this?
  	A can of caffeine before me.
  	What will I do?
  	Consume the zoom juice below me.
  	What is this feeling?
  	The caffeine is changing the "low" me.
  	What am I becoming?
  	A fucking laserbeam, homie.

    I consumed some Twix today. I was reminded of the feeling I get upon consuming chocolate. The first bite into the chocolate causes the skin around my jaw to feel fuzzy. The jaw also feels as though it is vibrating. Perhaps my jaw is learning how to phase like The Flash. My jaw is a speedster, the fastest jaw alive, capable of oh so rapid mastication. The jaw wishes to go zoom zoom, and it seems as though this chocolate will allow it to do so. Maybe my jaw will finally be free, free from bondage within my body. That Twix was rather good though. Yum yum.

    Practicing with the drumsticks creates fiction where they meet my thumb and index finger. I suppose some fine sanding takes place on the surface of my thumb, and to some extent my index finger. This sanding makes them feel quite soft and smooth. There is no pain, just a nice texture. For those who wish to have skin as smooth as the skin on my thumb, you must do the following:

    Say a clam is an n-order being. The shell is the tough exterior. Let's say it represents flesh and all that in material for the n-dimensional being. Now, consider the meat inside. This is the clam's soul. Upon the clam's death the shell is pryed open to reveal the meat, just as one's soul is exposed for judgement upon death. We, the n+1th order being casts judgement on the soul of the clam. We consume and provide for it an afterlife within our digestive tracts. How scrumptious. Now, let us place ourselves in the position of the clam. Perhaps an n+2th order being will separate our flesh from soul and cast judgement. Maybe one day, we too will know guts and glory.

    Ah, Boston. A city of opportunity, and as of late M U R D E R. Multiple murders have taken place across multiple college campuses. The things tying them together? A cumulative GPA of 3.7. The A- murderer is a true fiend. Boston Police Department is trying to handle the case, but they are having some difficulty in doing so. They thought they could handle it alone. In embarrassment they pick up the phone. The camera zooms in on the eyes of the officer operating the phone. They proceed to call...the university police departments...and maybe the transit police too. The phone rings twice before the recipients pick up. They're all excited to join in. All the police departments pull up in their Ford SUVs, eager to help. The transit police officer pulls up in a sedan. He's been doing this 30 years now. He doesn't need to be dealing with this shit. He doesn't know why, but years on the job have taught him not to question authority. Everyone is gathered in the briefing room. The young, bright faces of the university police officers carry darting eyes, eager to pounce on the case with their high quality... uh... police skills. Sure. The transit dude's looks grizzled as ever. They all get briefed up. Everyone know's what's up. The Boston police officer sighs a final sigh of embarrassment and expresses that any help will be appreciated. The Berklee police office springs to his feet. "I'm in!", he sings. Flawless son of a bitch. Everyone looks at this crazy ass musical motherfucker. After a solid 3 minutes, others stand and express their willingness to join in. One by one, everyone is deciding to participate. The enthusiasm in the room grows high... only the dude from transit remains. "Turdy yeehus I bin doin dis rite heeya jwob, an if you youngins ah willin to pahticipate, I prahbably should too. Nanna didn't raise no bitch.", He announces. He joins them. They feel ready. They feel empowered. The A- serial killer is going down. The camera pans to the main doors of the precinct. All the officers walk out. Single file. Slow motion. They're keeping it classy. They all head to their Ford SUVs. The transit guy joins the BUPD guys. He doesn't want no creaky ass sedan. Over the comms, one message is heard by all. "Alright boys, let's get this sonnovabitch."

    WA "chunk" should be the plural for multiple grains of rice put together. Chunk is easy to remember, it is simple to say, and requires low effort with regards to imagination. If you have another idea for identifying rice in its plural form, then you can shut the fuck up. Your efforts are not appreciated.

    We have ways to make chicken boneless after death. What if we could genetically engineer chickens to be boneless from birth. This would make boneless meat cheaper. Consumers become happy. Capitalism prevails. Substantial satisfaction is had. Think about it. Oh, I understand that the lives of the poultry will be quite miserable. But, survival of the fittest. Et cetera.
