    We have ways to make chicken boneless after death. What if we could genetically engineer chickens to be boneless from birth. This would make boneless meat cheaper. Consumers become happy. Capitalism prevails. Substantial satisfaction is had. Think about it. Oh, I understand that the lives of the poultry will be quite miserable. But, survival of the fittest. Et cetera.

    WA "chunk" should be the plural for multiple grains of rice put together. Chunk is easy to remember, it is simple to say, and requires low effort with regards to imagination. If you have another idea for identifying rice in its plural form, then you can shut the fuck up. Your efforts are not appreciated.

    Ah, Boston. A city of opportunity, and as of late M U R D E R. Multiple murders have taken place across multiple college campuses. The things tying them together? A cumulative GPA of 3.7. The A- murderer is a true fiend. Boston Police Department is trying to handle the case, but they are having some difficulty in doing so. They thought they could handle it alone. In embarrassment they pick up the phone. The camera zooms in on the eyes of the officer operating the phone. They proceed to call...the university police departments...and maybe the transit police too. The phone rings twice before the recipients pick up. They're all excited to join in. All the police departments pull up in their Ford SUVs, eager to help. The transit police officer pulls up in a sedan. He's been doing this 30 years now. He doesn't need to be dealing with this shit. He doesn't know why, but years on the job have taught him not to question authority. Everyone is gathered in the briefing room. The young, bright faces of the university police officers carry darting eyes, eager to pounce on the case with their high quality... uh... police skills. Sure. The transit dude's looks grizzled as ever. They all get briefed up. Everyone know's what's up. The Boston police officer sighs a final sigh of embarrassment and expresses that any help will be appreciated. The Berklee police office springs to his feet. "I'm in!", he sings. Flawless son of a bitch. Everyone looks at this crazy ass musical motherfucker. After a solid 3 minutes, others stand and express their willingness to join in. One by one, everyone is deciding to participate. The enthusiasm in the room grows high... only the dude from transit remains. "Turdy yeehus I bin doin dis rite heeya jwob, an if you youngins ah willin to pahticipate, I prahbably should too. Nanna didn't raise no bitch.", He announces. He joins them. They feel ready. They feel empowered. The A- serial killer is going down. The camera pans to the main doors of the precinct. All the officers walk out. Single file. Slow motion. They're keeping it classy. They all head to their Ford SUVs. The transit guy joins the BUPD guys. He doesn't want no creaky ass sedan. Over the comms, one message is heard by all. "Alright boys, let's get this sonnovabitch."
